        <h2>What is HSCT and Why Clinica Ruiz?</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>
                <p>A few preliminary facts about the HSCT treatment available in Mexico. . . . HSCT as a general chemotherapy procedure is performed throughout Mexico (for cancer) at various hospital facilities. However, there is only one organization (two facility locations) that we are currently aware of in Mexico in which (non-myeloablative) HSCT is performed as the most effective *legitimate* medical treatment for a diverse set of hematologically-rooted autoimmune diseases, which is Clinica Ruiz (following website). In addition, HSCT treatment at the Clinica Ruiz facility appears to address the big three hurdles most patients seeking HSCT face:
                <ol>
                    <li>1) Treatment cost or price (Clinica Ruiz is among one of the most affordable HSCT treatment facilities available for patients that provides complete comprehensive outpatient treatment for $54,500 for neurologic disease transplantation, and $59,500 for rheumatic disease (scleroderma and lupus) transplantation which is less expensive than most other HSCT treatment facilities around the world.</li>
                    <li>2) Transplantation of a wide spectrum of neurologic and other hematologically-rooted autoimmune diseases.
                Mexico will also transplant patients recently diagnosed (less than <4 months) with type I diabetes, including very young children. It's important for these patients to take special note: **** time is of the essence. **** Patients must be transplanted at the soonest possible date following the diagnosis onset of type I diabetes to halt the autoimmune attack and subsequent destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas in order to prevent (or reduce) the necessity of relying on a lifetime of insulin injections. HSCT will not be effective to cure or help patients diagnosed for an extended period of time (more than 6-8 months) with type I diabetes. For more information and details, please inquire in the forum.
                So long as the patient is deemed otherwise suitably healthy to tolerate the treatment without being placed at undue treatment risk (all patients will be evaluated prior to undergoing HSCT), the following is a list of autoimmune diseases that the clinic accepts, and will transplant:
                Neurological:
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - All forms (RR, SP, PP, PR)</li>
                    <li>Chronic Inflammatory Demylinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)</li>
                    <li>Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO)</li>
                    <li>Transverse Myelitis (TM)</li>
                    <li>Myasthenia Gravis (MG)</li>
                    <li>Multifocal Motor Neuropathy (MMN)</li>
                </ul>
                
                Other autoimmune disease types:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)</li>
                    <li>Sjogren Syndrome (SS)</li>
                    <li>Uveitis</li>
                    <li>Scleroderma (all forms, not just systemic sclerosis)</li>
                    <li>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)</li>
                    <li>Vasculitis & vasculitis sub types</li>
                    <li>Type I diabetes (transplantation must be performed within approximately ~4-6 months following initial diagnosis).</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            <li>3) Will transplant patients with a relatively high level of disability that are not completely bedridden (MS up to EDSS 8.0).</li>
               <br> A little more detail regarding Clinica Ruiz. . . . . it was founded in 1923 in Puebla, Mexico by a multi-generational medical family (Ruiz) and continues into the third generation of medical doctors today. The current head & principal doctor is Dr. Guillermo Ruiz that is classically trained in internal medicine and hematology that further went on to complete his post-doctoral research fellow program in hematology at the Department of Hematology of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, USA. Dr. Ruiz employs his extensive expertise in performing HSCT originally intended for cancer and has successfully applied it to healing people with hematologically-rooted autoimmune diseases that most often *best* benefit from this legitimate and lifesaving medical intervention, just as several other noted doctors have successfully done at other facilities around the world. Additional details about Dr. Ruiz, the Clinica Ruiz medical center and their HSCT treatment protocol detail can be found in the Files section.</p>
