        <h3>British Virgin Islands</h3>
        <p>One of the best vacations that my husband and I ever took was to the British Virgin Islands.  We flew into the US Virgin Islands and ferried over to Tortola.  We stayed two nights in Tortola before we hopped a chartered catamaran for the week.  While on the chartered catamaran we toured Peter Island, Pusser's Island, Virgin Gorda, Anegada, Jost Van Dyke and Norman Island before returning to port in Tortola.  Each island offered so much beauty with flora and fauna, remarkable snorkeling or diving depending on where we were, nightlife for those who seeked it, or just the peace of mooring in the ocean and enjoying the views of picturesque sunsets.</p>

        <h4>Would I Go Again?</h4>
        <span>Simply my answer is yes!  I always will remember that experience prior to Hurricane Maria and even though there was significant damage, I know that they have recovered some what but that they rely heavily on tourism to thrive once again.</span>
